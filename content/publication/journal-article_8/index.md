abstract: "Humans tend to spend most of their life indoors, making the quality of indoor environments essential for human health and wellbeing. While several solutions for monitoring the indoor environment have been proposed, ranging from infrastructure-based monitoring solutions to cameras, these tend to require separate installation, making the sensors difficult to maintain and upgrade. In this article, we introduce the idea of using smart plants as an easy-to-deploy and affordable solution for monitoring the indoor environment. Plants are typically deployed close to humans and they increasingly are placed in containers that integrate sensors, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and CO2 sensors. We demonstrate how these sensors can be used as an alternative technology for monitoring—and enriching—indoor spaces without needing to install proprietary sensors or other technology. Specifically, we show how smart plants can be used to estimate overall CO2 accumulation, occupancy information, and whether people use protective face masks or not. We also establish a research roadmap for the use of smart plants to monitor indoor environments."

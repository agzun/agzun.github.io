abstract: "Littering is a significant challenge for environmental sustainability and a major burden for cities and densely populated areas. Current solutions for litter monitoring, such as litter watch campaigns and city-operated litter collection, are costly and challenging to conduct at a large scale. This article presents a vision for using autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) for litter monitoring and removal and introduces a mechanism for AGVs that uses thermal dissipation resulting from sunlight to identify and remove litter objects. We identify and highlight key challenges for deploying the envisioned solution on a city scale, and demonstrate the feasibility of the solution through extensive experiments."

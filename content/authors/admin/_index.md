I am a postdoctoral researcher of computer science at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, Finland. I received my PhD on computer science in December 2023. My research is dedicated to advancing data quality, sensing and modelling methods in Pervasive Data Science (PDS) and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). I am particularly passionate about developing innovative, cost-effective solutions for intelligent sensing pipelines that support end-user applications and contribute to sustainable ecosystems. I contribute actively to the research community, especially ACM (SIGMOBILE) and IEEE, publishing in top-tier conferences and journals like The Web Conference, IEEE PerCom, ACM IMWUT, and IEEE Pervasive Computing; and serving as reviewer for major conferences and journals, including Scientific Reports, ACM IMWUT, ACM ITICSE, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, and IEEE Pervasive Computing. In addition to my research activities, my teaching philosophy centers on creating dynamic learning environments that prioritize student-centered approaches and facilitate learning through reflection and interaction. Committed to democratizing science, I co-created the Introduction to the IOT MOOC (https://iot.mooc.fi), which currently has over 600 students.
